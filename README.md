## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello, I'm Luis Miguel Atienza, an aspiring worker in programming and design. My main works are graphic designing, front-end development, and game art designs. I do art projects and designs on Canva, Adobe Creative Suite/InDesign, and Clip Studio Paint. I use Adobe Premiere Pro/Photoshop, Unity, Unreal Engine, and Visual Studio Code to edit front-end websites and graphic designing.
